		This rule says that new players shall be inserted relative to the
		current list of active raiders. When there are n active, listed,
		players in a raid, there are n+1 holes to which a new player may
		be inserted. The new player shall roll from 1 to n+1 and will then
		occupy that hole. The insertion with respect to the master list
		will occur either immediately before the first active raider, or
		immediately after the appropriate active raider.
